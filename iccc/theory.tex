\section{On Generating Comics}

The computational generation of comics presents a novel challenge. Comics 
share structural similarity to written text~\cite{saraceni2016relatedness}: 
they are both made up of individual elements (sentences in text, frames in 
comics), delimited by special-purpose symbols (full stops in text, frame 
borders in comics), which can be easily identified, and which can contain a 
variable amount of information. However, unlike text, comics afford an additional \emph{pictorial} dimension through which to express information. To 
\citeA{cohn2013visual}, comics are one instance of the more broader 
\emph{theory of visual language}, which itself is used to communicate via
a palette of visual elements and their spatial relationships to one another,
e.g. their relative size, rotation, horizontal and vertical juxtaposition, 
and distance. While in general comics offer two authorship affordances 
(textual and visual language), in this work we are concerned only with 
the pictorial dimension.

One interesting and paradoxical aspect of purely-visual comics is how
constrained they for conveying narrative structure. The constraint is 
two-fold. Firstly, there is a practical constraint in that there are 
only so many visual elements that can be placed in a particular frame
before the ensemble becomes too littered to understand. Secondly, there
is an attentional constraint in that (even if we were to somehow mediate
the first concern) a potential story consumer could be potentially
disengaged at the prospect of having to parse an overwhelming amount of
visual detail. There thus exists a tacit expectation on behalf of story
consumers that authors will make their contributions to the narrative arc
as brief and relevant as they need to be, in a manner parallel to the
expected conduct of people engaged in cooperative conversation as outlined 
by \citeA{grice1975logic}. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item From a computational narratology perspective, it seems prudent
		to focus on the discourse, since it is the primary point of contact
		for the narrative artifact between the story and human who reconstructs it.
		
	\item Nonetheless, coherent structure is important (Graesser, Olde, Kletteke)
	
	\item Indeed, \citeA{saraceni2016relatedness} argues that comic structure 
		ought to demonstrate \emph{relatedness}, which spans from the structural
		aspects of discourse to the cognitive aspects of discourse (which turns
		out to be the structural aspect of stories, needed for sense-making).
		
	\item Since what we developed was a minimal model, we focused on generation of
		the structural, but keeping in mind the context of the cognitive (i.e.
		the simulation of narrative structure for coherence). Developed two models,
		one based on Understanding Comics~\cite{mcCloud1993understanding}, and
		another based on Visual Language of Comics~\cite{cohn2013visual}.
\end{itemize}




% Human brains' ability to fill in gaps is also why comics are simpler than
% animation in this respect: animations are expected to provide continuous
% motion between frames, whereas two comic frames need only be plausibly
% connected by some narrative justification. And that's where transition types
% come in: when you exclude non sequiturs, they constrain the space of next
% panels to ones that "make sense."

\begin{itemize} \item Why are comics a great domain for computational
creativity? \begin{itemize} \item Talk about how creative the discipline is
\item Motivated by the exploration of computational creativity to novel domains
\end{itemize} \item What are we trying to do? \item What is our approach? \item
Why does discourse-driven help creativity in narrative generation?
\begin{itemize} \item Creative potential is bigger in discourse-driven approach,
principle of least-commitment in the fabula - don't need to simulate a portion
of the narrative universe which is never revealed which may impose limitations
on future narrative generation. \note{RCR}{Example!}

			\item Focusing on the telling may leave aspects of fabula
			unspecified, which may broaden the interpretation of the story in
			the minds of story consumers. \note{RCR}{Example!} \item Talk about
			the pipeline model of narrative generation (primarily simulation
			focused) \item We're exploring an alternative account - focus on the
			telling of the story, let story consumers ``fill in the gaps''

			\begin{itemize} \item Gricean Maxims \item Closure principle
			Saraceni - Third aspect of ``relatedness'', depends on not what is
			overtly explicit in the narrative's surface code, but also on
			inference.  ``Closure'' comes from Gestalt principles. \item Gestalt
			principle \end{itemize} \end{itemize}
