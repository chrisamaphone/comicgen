Actionable feedback from reviews:

"The paper could be improved by focusing more in what it actually delivers,
and analyzing in detail and systematically (i.e. in a rigorous way) its
strengths and weaknesses."

"The introduction has some confusing parts. I'm still not too sure why the
"pipeline model" is unnecessary and insufficient. That could use a little
more explaining. Particularly the 3rd paragraph talks about it being
unnecessary to simulate aspects of the narrative that are never
communicated. It is unclear if the authors are supporting that notion or
disputing it."

"It is hard to see the connection between the cognitive/linguistic theories
and how that translates into the (simple) computational system you describe
at a high level. Is it possible to describe the proposed system/model on a
more formal level with more detail?"

"Because the system is still proof-of-concept, a stronger discussion on the
cognitive theories mentioned in the paper would be very beneficial. It
would be good to elaborate and explain them in more detail and to discuss
how they relate to general notions/theories of the creative process."

"It may be useful to mention more specifically how the cognitive aspects
mentioned in the paper, and in particular the "filling the gap"  aspect
relates to Pablo Gervas's ideas."
