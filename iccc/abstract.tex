% Narrative generation is important
Narrative generation enables a range of opportunities for understanding 
the creative act of storytelling.
% but standard pipeline model has limits
Prior approaches have mostly converged on a pipeline model, wherein
story structure is generated first, and discourse structure is
generated after, mapping individual story events to discourse elements. 
% our approach 
This model, however, unnecessarily limits narrative possibilities, and 
we investigate a new model based on discourse theories. In particular, 
% Comics offer good discourse theory
because \emph{comics} offer a rich discourse theory, we built a
comic generator to study \emph{discourse-driven} narrative generation.  
Unlike prior work, we generate comics to the level of visual element
positions, rather than rearranging pre-existing panels.  
Our approach is based on leading discourse theories for comics by McCloud
(panel transitions) and Cohn (narrative grammar).
% results
Our contributions are a proof-of-concept generator with a wide range of
abstract comic output, a computational realization of McCloud's and Cohn's
comics theories, and a modular algorithm that affords the evaluation of 
visual discourse theories.
