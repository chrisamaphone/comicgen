% Narrative generation is important
Narrative generation enables a range of opportunities for understanding 
the creative act of storytelling.
% but standard pipeline model has limits
Prior approaches have mostly converged on a pipeline model, wherein story
structure is generated as a precursor to discourse structure, mapping
individual story events to discourse elements. 
This model, however, unnecessarily limits narrative possibilities by
disallowing discourse generation to restructure the story.
Most prior work avoids the limitations of the pipeline model by implicitly
assuming a textual output medium; these assumptions do not transfer well to
visual media.

% our approach 
We investigate a new generation approach that treats discourse as
primary, using {\em comic generation} as a testbed.  Our approach is based
on leading discourse theories for comics by McCloud (panel transitions) and
Cohn (narrative grammar).  Unlike prior comic generation work, rather than
rearranging pre-existing panels, we also generate the configurations of
visual elements that populate each panel. 
% results
Our contributions are a proof-of-concept generator with a wide range of
abstract comic output, a computational realization of McCloud's and Cohn's
comics theories, and a modular algorithm that affords the evaluation of
visual discourse theories.
