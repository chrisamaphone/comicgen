@article{zwaan1998situation,
	Abstract = {This article reviews research on the use of situation models in language comprehension and memory retrieval over the past 15 years. Situation models are integrated mental representations of a described state of affairs. Significant progress has been made in the scientific understanding of how situation models are involved in language comprehension and memory retrieval. Much of this research focuses on establishing the existence of situation models, often by using tasks that assess one dimension of a situation model. However, the authors argue that the time has now come for researchers to begin to take the multidimensionality of situation models seriously. The authors offer a theoretical framework and some methodological observations that may help researchers to tackle this issue.},

@article{gerrig1994readers,
	Abstract = {We suggest that readers' reports of suspense are moderated by their perceptions of the range of solutions available to a textual dilemma. We provide seven experimts to test this relationship between problem solving and suspense. In each experiment subjects read texts that placed James Bond (or some other fictional hero) in a situation of grave danger. The texts differed with respect to the apparent range of escapes available to the hero. Subjects gave ratings of the likelihood that the hero would escape and of their feelings of suspense. Although ratings of likelihood were little affected, ratings of suspense were heightened when readers believed that the number of paths to a solution had been restricted.},
	Annote = {There are two main points that they try to make.  The first is that readers experience a problem-solving like mechanism when they read narratives.  (Note that this assumes that there is something to be solved!) As part of this problem-solving mechanism:  

        
``[Classic analyses of problem solving] use the metaphor of searching a space to conceptualize the process of finding a solution (Newell and Simon, 1972).  Against this theory, [the characters of a story] try to find the solution to a `transformation' problem (Greeno, 1978).''

        
This type of problem solving establishes an initial state, and a goal state.  To ``solve'' the problem, find a path through an appropriate sequence of intermediate states

        
* From a Computer Science perspective, this is identical to an AI Planning Problem

        
In problem solving, the difficulty of a problem is determined (ceteris paribus) by:
    1. The number of useful paths through a problem space
    2. The difficulty of executing the transitions between intermediate states (the moves)

        
Visualizing problem-solving as a search of possible solution paths, means that when reading, readers are experiencing a search through solution paths.  Their second point is that as part of this search process, readers experienced heightened suspense when possible solution paths are pruned (this is actually their hypothesis).

        
Note!  If readers are not aware of a possible solution path, then it does not contribute to the suspense they feel.  The text must ``offer and then snatch [the solution] away''.

        
- What are the paper's assumptions?

        
The paper's explicit assumption is that reading can be visualized as an exercise in problem solving.  The paper does present a (in my mind) valid justification to this.

        
- What are the major claims?

        
The authors provide six experiments to demonstrate that the pruning of possible solution paths does in fact create a heightened state of suspense.

        

        
In general, their results were favorable.

        
Noteworthy experiments:
---
Experiment 1: Tested basic analogy between readers' perceptions of the set of possible solutions to a textual dilemma and their feelings of suspense.

        
Noteworthy:  ``Readers need not have any precisely articulated notion of any actual solution paths.  What is more important is the readers' belief that a solution path is available (even though they might have no idea how to get there).

        
Results:  Higher ratings of suspense when solution path (regarding an item) was pruned.

        
Problem?  ``It could be the mere mention of an item and not its removal brings increased suspense.''  Onward to E2!
---

        
---
Experiment 2:  Replicate Experiment 1 and never remove the item that was removed in E1 (when it was removed in E1, a solution path was pruned).

        
Results:  Removing the item causes higher ratings of suspense than not removing it.
---

        
---
Experiment 3:  Extend the results of E1 by using another object; Try to see if perceptions of suspense are affected by the value of objects that have not been undermined by ordinary use.

        
``In this third experiment we created a textual analog to a situation of functional fixedness to show that readers' suspense ratings were reduced if they overlooked a potential solution.

        
Aside:  overlooking a potential solution could potentially be linked with affordances; when objects are designed to evoke certain uses, you could think of an ``opportunity cost'' in that they don't evoke OTHER uses. When they DON'T evoke those uses, those uses are OVERLOOKED.  

        
Imagine a game that presents tools that could be used for alternate purposes, but it isn't until a game player is made aware of this alternate use is the affordance ``perceived''.

        
Results: Functional fixedness can be exploited to influence readers' perceptions of suspense.

        

        
- If I were to build a system out of this, how would I do it?

        
Knowing that readers execute problem-solving in a plan-like representation makes it easy to go to claim that plans are good models of the structure of people's thoughts as they go through the story.

        
- Does this paper solve the field?  If not, what did they do wrong?

        
One very glaring error in their analysis is that they reported mean/SD/and statistical significant difference over nominal data!  This is kind of crucial, as it breaks the entire analysis.
