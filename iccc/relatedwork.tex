\section{Related Work}


Historically, the computational generation of narrative has followed what
\citeA{ronfard2014story} term the \emph{pipeline model}: a narrative
artifact is computationally generated by first simulating the story world
as a collection of events, and then piping the story world information to a
discourse generator, which generates a selective presentation of story
world events in a particular medium. Current work in the computational
creativity community has primarily pursued this pipeline model for
narrative generation. Work by \note{RCR}{There are several papers to cite
here, but the gist is: pipeline model is pervasive.}

As \citeauthor{ronfard2014story} argue, the pipeline model is neither
\emph{necessary} nor \emph{sufficient} for the successful generation of
narrative structure, but rather represents one paradigm of narrative
generation.  \note{RCR}{Present one example of why it's not necessary, and
one example of why it's not sufficient.}


Our work presents a departure from the pipeline model, opting instead for a
\emph{discourse-first approach to narrative generation}. 

\note{RCR}{Why? Argument for creativity?}


In this model, the
story world is simulated inasmuch as is necessary to support the telling of
story events in the discourse. The work we present here is a first step in
this discourse-driven model, focused on understanding how the discourse of
visual language narratives enforces constraints on the underlying story
worlds they represent, and how these can further guide subsequent choices
for discursive presentation.

Narrative authors design their narratives to affect audiences in specific
ways (Bordwell), and authors care to structure discourse to achieve
specific narratological effects.  This is achievable in the pipeline model,
but reasoning about discourse first helps you catch things that are not
realizable in a specific target medium (e.g. identity for murderers in
thrillers.)
