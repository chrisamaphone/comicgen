\section{Conclusion}

% presented a small-scale computational system for generating comics down
% to the level of visual elements within panels, as a vector for exploring
% discourse-driven narrative generation
We have presented a small-scale computational system for generating comics,
down to the level of visual elements within panels, informed by leading
narrative discourse theories.
% reiterate takeaway: both top-down and bottom-up theories are needed.
% bottom-up generation enforces relatedness and cohesion (coherence?),
% but top-down generation is needed for global structure.
Our takeaway lesson is that both local and global procedures are
necessary for coherent and cohesive discourse generation: global top-down
structure is required for global coherence, while local bottom-up information
about the relationships between generated elements are needed for local
cohesion. Our algorithms and implementation offer a promising starting
point for the computational investigation of discourse-driven narrative
theories.
