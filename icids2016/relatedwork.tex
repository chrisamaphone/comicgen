\section{Related Work}

% As discussed in the Introduction, the pipeline model of narrative generation 
% has been the dominant paradigm to narrative generation. 
% In this section we
% review some exemplars of that model, with special focus on systems that have
% been covered in the computational creativity community.

While no other work we are aware of presents an implemented theory of
visual narrative generation departing from the pipeline model, there is
some related work that follows said model.
%
% For instance, Guerrero and P\'erez y P\'erez~\cite{guerrero2014social} developed a
% nuanced computational model of social norms to drive the interaction of
% characters in the simulation of the story world. Their work defers the
% development of the main plot to MEXICA~\cite{perez2001mexica}, a
% computational implementation of a cognitively-oriented account of writing.
% However MEXICA itself is primarily a story-level reasoner, since it leaves
% unspecified how the story structures that it generates via computational
% \emph{engagement} and \emph{reflection} are realized into narrative text. 
%
% While MEXICA itself follows the pipeline model of narrative generation, its
For instance, MEXICA~\cite{perez2001mexica}'s
engagement--reflection (E--R) model of authorship represents a
\emph{tandem-process model}, which is similar to our account of discourse
reasoning. In MEXICA, the plot elaboration component (the \emph{engagement}
phase) is responsible for constructing an initial story framework, which is
refined by a critic (the \emph{reflection} phase). In our work, the
discourse elaboration component (the local reasoner) is responsible for
constructing an initial discourse structure, which is refined by a critic
(the global reasoner).  Further, the E--R cycle is a
\emph{cognitively-oriented} narrative generation process; P\'erez y P\'erez
leveraged information on how humans cognitively engage with the narrative
authorship process in order to inform their system design. In our work, we
too took a cognitive orientation by looking at how humans parse comic
discourse structure to inform the design of our comic discourse generator.

Montfort et al.~\cite{montfort2013slant} developed a blackboard
architecture called Slant for story generation that integrates several
different sub-components systems to generate a story. While the system's
architecture is primarily dedicated to the specification and refinement of
rules to generate plot structure, Slant does include a sub-component called
Verso, which reasons over narrative discourse as a way to further constrain
the narrative plot. In particular, Verso detects aspects of the verbs used
during the generation of plot structure, and determines the in-progress
story's match to a specific genre.\footnote{Verso's operationalization of
genre differs from the literary sense of the term, but a full discussion of
this is beyond the scope of our work.} Once a specific genre has been
identified, Verso poses additional constraints to the plot generator via
the Slant blackboard. Slant is thus not strictly a pipeline model
architecture, but unfortunately the constraints identified during discourse
reasoning cannot themselves inform further discourse reasoning. In our
approach, we hope to identify discourse-driven narrative generation that
informs or constrains both the generation of the underlying plot structure,
as well as the further generation of narrative discourse.

Most relevant to the work we pursue here is the work by P\'erez y P\'erez
et al.~\cite{perezyperez2012illustrating}, who developed a visual
illustrator to their MEXICA system. They sought to verify the degree to
which their 3-panel comic generator elicited in readers the same sense of
story as a textual realization of the same MEXICA-generated plot. While
this system still follows the pipeline model of narrative generation, we
see their work as complementary: they developed an experiment methodology
through which it is possible to empirically assess if their palette of
designed visual elements denote story concepts as intended.  Future work in
discourse-driven comic generation will have to address this point going
forward, and P\'erez y P\'erez et al. provide a step toward understanding
the gap between story concepts and the computational symbols meant to
encode them. A potential improvement to their system that the authors
identify as most important was: ``to provide the Visual Narrator with
mechanisms that allow more freedom during the composition
process''~\cite{perezyperez2012illustrating}. Our work here aims to provide
just that.
