Narrative generation enables a range of opportunities for understanding the creative act of storytelling.  Prior approaches have mostly converged on a pipeline model, wherein story structure is generated as a precursor to discourse structure, mapping individual story events to discourse elements.  This model, however, unnecessarily limits narrative possibilities.  We investigate a new generation approach that treats discourse as primary, using {\em comic generation} as a testbed.  Our approach is based on leading discourse theories for comics by McCloud (panel transitions) and Cohn (narrative grammar). Rather than rearranging pre-existing panels, we generate panel contents based on notions supported by cognitive theories of visual language.  We present a proof-of-concept generator with a wide range of abstract comic output, a computational realization of McCloud's and Cohn's comics theories, and a modular algorithm that affords the evaluation of visual discourse theories.
