We investigate a new approach to comic generation that explores the process
of generating the contents of a panel given the contents of all previous
panels.  Our approach is based on leading discourse theories for comics by
McCloud (panel transitions) and Cohn (narrative grammar), unified by
cognitive theories of inference in visual language.  We apply these
theories to comics whose panel paremeters are abstract geometric shapes and
their positions, contributing a computational realization of McCloud's and
Cohn's comics theories, as well as a modular algorithm that affords further
experimentation and evaluation of visual discourse theories.
