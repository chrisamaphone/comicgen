\section{Conclusion}

In this work we have presented an approach to comic generation combining
local, transition-driven decisions with global syntactic structure. We
initially designed our system to tend only to textual factors in
comic discourse: the repetition of comic actants across the narrative
provides a minimal cohesive backbone on which to pin comic understanding.
%
However, as discussed, this form of generation could generate non-sensical
output (e.g. ending comics with a \emph{meanwhile} discourse transition).
We therefore appealed to more cognitively-oriented factors via the theory
of visual grammar, which helped structure the output in a way that enables
other senses of relatedness to contribute to the output's coherence.
%
Thus, through our small-scale system, we have begun to explore the scale
and limits of human story sense-making faculties, as well as how they come
to bear on narrative generation systems: in our case, through both local
and global procedures, which inform cohesion and coherence, respectively. 
%
% Our algorithms and implementation offer a promising starting point for the
% computational investigation of discourse-driven narrative.

% More broadly, our work highlights the importance of looking to human
% cognition as a point of departure for the design of narrative generators.
% Other scholars~(e.g. Gervas~\cite{gervas2009computational} and
% Szilas~\cite{szilas2010requirements}) have argued the same point; our
% system provides a computational system that demonstrates it. Concretely,
% the reason for this is that humans bring significant cognitive faculties to
% bear on the process of narrative
% comprehension~\cite{herman2013storytelling}.  An instance of this narrative
% intelligence is our unique ability to fill in the blanks in the liminal
% spaces of discourse, which (at least) relies on  our focalized perspectives
% into the story world~\cite{genette1983narrative}.  As our generated comics
% show, our narrative sense-making abilities allow us to intuit and impose
% narrative structure on the sequence of depicted images, due to how we fill
% in the blanks left unspecified in our comics. Therefore, this mental
% process has a significant role in our appreciation of the narrative
% artifact, and should have an equally significant role in the generation of
% it.
